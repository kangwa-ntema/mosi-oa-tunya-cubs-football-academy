        <h2 className="approachSubHeadline">Academic Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          We understand the importance of a balanced life. We request regular academic progress reports from parents to support a crucial balance between sports and academics. Children are also encouraged to share their homework with the academy to ensure they are engaged in academic work and improving in that department, maintaining an overall academic atmosphere.

      <div className="approachSection homeworkProgramSection">
        <h2 className="approachSubHeadline">Homework Program</h2>
        <p>
          Our unique homework program provides at-home drills and exercises, with video submissions for personalized feedback. These drills are simple and mainly require players to shoot a 1-minute video of them doing an assigned drill, primarily aimed at addressing individual areas for improvement. This allows for continuous development outside of structured training.
